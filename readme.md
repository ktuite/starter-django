# Starter Django Project

Components:
* Login system (with pages for registering, signing in, and password recovery)
* Bootstrap CSS and JQuery Javascript
* Example urls, models, views
* Saving user data to media folder

Things to customize:
* Database: local sqlite file or real mysql server
* Email address for sending password recovery (I just use a Gmail account)
